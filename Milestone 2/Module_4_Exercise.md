# Milestone 2: Prototyping a Small Café's Website

## Overview

For Milestone 2, we are advancing from requirement gathering to prototyping. This phase involves creating low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes for a small café's homepage, as well as developing other essential website pages using Figma.

---

## Exercise 1: Low-fidelity Prototype

- **Objective**: Create a low-fidelity prototype for the homepage of a small café's website.
- **Method**: Sketch a rough layout focusing on the placement of navigation, text, images, and buttons.
- **Reflection**: Analyze which Gestalt laws and UX principles have been applied in the prototype.

## Exercise 2: High-fidelity Prototyping with Figma

- **Objective**: Translate the low-fidelity prototype into a digital high-fidelity version using Figma.
- **Tasks**:
  - Create frames for the homepage and additional pages: Menu, About Us, Contact.
  - Utilize Figma's prototyping features to link the pages, ensuring that interactive elements like the 'Menu' button navigate to the corresponding page.
  - Preview and test the prototype flow using the 'Present' feature.

## Exercise 3: AI-Assisted Prototyping with Dall-E

- **Objective**: Leverage AI to generate visual prototypes and compare them to manually created ones.
- **Tasks**:
  - Create prompts for Dall-E to generate a prototype for the homepage, reflecting the layout designed in Exercise 1.
  - Compare the AI-generated prototype with the Figma prototype from Exercise 2, noting differences and potential improvements.
