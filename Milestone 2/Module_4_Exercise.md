# Milestone 2: Prototyping a Small Café's Website

## Overview

For Milestone 2, we are advancing from requirement gathering to prototyping. This phase involves creating low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes for a small café's homepage, as well as developing other essential website pages using Figma.

## Exercise 1: Low-fidelity Prototype

- **Objective**: Create a low-fidelity prototype for the homepage of a small café's website.
- **Method**: Sketch a rough layout focusing on the placement of navigation, text, images, and buttons.
- **Reflection**: Analyze which Gestalt laws and UX principles have been applied in the prototype.

  Some of the gestalt laws and UX principles used:
  
  - Law of Proximity: Elements are placed close together to indicate they are related. For example, navigation elements like "Menu," "Contact," and "About Us" are grouped in the header to indicate they are part of the site's main navigation.
  - Law of Similarity: Similar elements are perceived as more related than dissimilar ones. This can be seen in the consistent design of buttons or icons, suggesting they perform similar actions or belong to the same category of interaction.
  - Law of Closure: The mind completes incomplete shapes. In my sketches, even though the buttons or navigation elements might not be fully detailed, the viewer's mind can fill in the gaps based on their previous experiences with similar interfaces.
  - Law of Symmetry: Symmetrical elements are perceived as part of the same group and are aesthetically pleasing.
  - UX Principle of Simplicity: The design should be simple to make it easy for users to accomplish their tasks. The low-fidelity prototype suggests a straightforward layout without unnecessary complications, focusing on the content and user tasks.

## Exercise 2: High-fidelity Prototyping with Figma

- **Objective**: Translate the low-fidelity prototype into a digital high-fidelity version using Figma.
- **Tasks**:
  - Create frames for the homepage and additional pages: Menu, About Us, Contact.
  - Utilize Figma's prototyping features to link the pages, ensuring that interactive elements like the 'Menu' button navigate to the corresponding page.
  - Preview and test the prototype flow using the 'Present' feature.
  - Added order and payment.
  - Added order complete.
  - Added test and survey feedback.

## Exercise 3: AI-Assisted Prototyping with Dall-E

- **Objective**: Leverage AI to generate visual prototypes and compare them to manually created ones.
- **Tasks**:
  - Create prompts for Dall-E to generate a prototype for the homepage, reflecting the layout designed in Exercise 1.
  - Compare the AI-generated prototype with the Figma prototype from Exercise 2, noting differences and potential improvements.

    Differences:
    - Navigation Placement: In the AI-generated prototype, the navigation might be more simplified, focusing on essential elements.
    - Visual Hierarchy: Our prototype may present a more refined visual hierarchy, with elements like "Order Now" buttons standing out more prominently.
    - Consistency: Our Figma prototype has a more consistent theme and styling that the AI-generated version might lack.
    - Imagery and Branding: Our Figma prototype may include more brand-specific imagery and elements that reflect the café's identity. The AI prototype might be generic and could benefit from more personalized touches that align with the café's brand.
    - Functionality: Interactive elements like the buttons we have used in the Figma prototype may be more thoughtfully placed and styled for user engagement. The AI version might require practical testing to ensure elements are not just visually appealing but also 
      functionally effective.
    - Feedback Mechanisms: Our Figma prototype includes elements that give users feedback, such as confirmation messages after an order is placed. Ensure the AI prototype also incorporates clear user feedback for interactions.

    Improvements:
    - We have added a feedback system for users to test our figma prototype.
    - We have added a order complete notifcation when the user has successfully ordered an item.
