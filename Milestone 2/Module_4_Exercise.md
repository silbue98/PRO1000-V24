# Milestone 2.4: Prototyping a Small CafÃ©'s Website

## Overview

For Milestone 2, we are advancing from requirement gathering to prototyping. This phase involves creating low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes for a small cafÃ©'s homepage, as well as developing other essential website pages using Figma.

## Exercise 1: Low-fidelity Prototype

- **Objective**: Create a low-fidelity prototype for the homepage of a small cafÃ©'s website.
- **Method**: Sketch a rough layout focusing on the placement of navigation, text, images, and buttons.
- **Reflection**: Analyze which Gestalt laws and UX principles have been applied in the prototype.

## Low-fidelity Sketches

As part of the design process, initial sketches were created to layout the basic structure and component placement for the cafÃ©'s homepage. Below are the links to the sketches that served as the foundation for our high-fidelity prototyping in Figma.

**Sketches**:

  Some of the gestalt laws and UX principles used:
  
  - Law of Proximity: Elements are placed close together to indicate they are related. For example, navigation elements like "Menu" "Contact" etc, are grouped in the header to indicate they are part of the site's main navigation.
  - Law of Similarity: Similar elements are perceived as more related than dissimilar ones. This can be seen in the consistent design of buttons or icons, suggesting they perform similar actions or belong to the same category of interaction.
  - Law of Closure: The mind completes incomplete shapes. In my sketches, even though the buttons or navigation elements might not be fully detailed, the viewer's mind can fill in the gaps based on their previous experiences with similar interfaces.
  - Law of Symmetry: Symmetrical elements are perceived as part of the same group and are aesthetically pleasing.
  - UX Principle of Simplicity: The design should be simple to make it easy for users to accomplish their tasks. The low-fidelity prototype suggests a straightforward layout without unnecessary complications, focusing on the content and user tasks.

## Exercise 2: High-fidelity Prototyping with Figma

- **Objective**: Translate the low-fidelity prototype into a digital high-fidelity version using Figma.
- **Tasks**:
  - Create frames for the homepage and additional pages: Menu, About Us, Contact.
  - Utilize Figma's prototyping features to link the pages, ensuring that interactive elements like the 'Menu' button navigate to the corresponding page.
  - Preview and test the prototype flow using the 'Present' feature.
  - We have implemented order and payment.
  - We have implemented order complete.
  - We have added test and survey feedback.
 
### Figma Prototype

### Feedback Survey
After completing an order, users will be automatically redirected to a feedback form after a short delay, ensuring valuable user insights are captured.

## Exercise 3: AI-Assisted Prototyping with Dall-E

- **Objective**: Leverage AI to generate visual prototypes and compare them to manually created ones.
- **Tasks**:
  - Create prompts for Dall-E to generate a prototype for the homepage, reflecting the layout designed in Exercise 1.
  - Compare the AI-generated prototype with the Figma prototype from Exercise 2, noting differences and potential improvements.


### AI Prototype Insights

View the AI-generated visual prototype and note the design choices:

**Differences Noted**:
- **Navigation**: The AI-generated prototype presents a non-traditional layout or structure. Resulting in a bad navigational experience for users.
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Contrastingly, the Figma prototype showcases a deliberate visual hierarchy, guiding users towards primary actions like placing an order.
- **Design Consistency**: The manually designed Figma prototype displays cohesive thematic elements, which might be less pronounced in the AI version.
- **Brand Representation**: The Figma prototype incorporates tailored branding elements that resonate with the cafÃ©'s unique identity, which may be absent in the generic AI-generated visuals.
- **Interactive Dynamics**: The Figma design considers the practicality and aesthetics of interactive elements, ensuring a balance between visual appeal and user experience.
- **User Interaction Feedback**: The Figma prototype includes explicit feedback mechanisms for user interactions, an aspect to be refined in the AI version.

**Potential Enhancements**:
- A feedback system is integrated into the Figma prototype, inviting user participation and evaluation.
- An order completion notification has been implemented, providing clear confirmation once a transaction is successfully processed.
