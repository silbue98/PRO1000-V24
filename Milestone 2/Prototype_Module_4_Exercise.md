# Milestone 2.4: Prototyping With Figma for USN Co-Working Space

## Overview

In Milestone 2, we transition from requirement gathering to prototyping for the USN Co-Working Space project. This phase involves creating both low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes for our project's homepage and developing additional website pages using Figma.

---

## Exercise 1: Low-fidelity Prototype

### Objective

Create a low-fidelity prototype for the USN Co-Working Space's website homepage, focusing on the layout and essential UI components.

### Sketches

Initial sketches provide a visual foundation for our high-fidelity prototyping efforts in Figma.

### Reflection

We applied several Gestalt laws and UX principles to enhance the user experience and intuitiveness of the layout:

- **Law of Proximity**: Grouping related items like navigation links to indicate their relationship.
- **Law of Similarity**: Using consistent design elements for actions of the same category.
- **Law of Closure**: Leveraging the user's perception to complete familiar shapes or forms.
- **Law of Symmetry**: Implementing symmetrical layouts for aesthetic appeal and balance.
- **Principle of Simplicity**: Ensuring a clean, uncluttered layout that focuses on user tasks.

## Exercise 2: High-fidelity Prototyping with Figma

### Objective

Translate the low-fidelity prototype into a high-fidelity digital version using Figma, complete with interactive elements and polished design.

### Tasks

- Create frames for essential pages: Homepage, Menu, About Us, Contact.
- Link pages using Figma's prototyping features for a seamless user flow.
- Preview the prototype by using the 'Present' feature in Figma.

### Additional Implementations

- Order and payment processes.
- Order completion confirmation.
- User testing and survey feedback mechanism.

## Exercise 3: AI-Assisted Prototyping with Dall-E

### Objective

Explore the potential of AI in generating visual prototypes and compare them with manually created versions in Figma.

### Comparison and Insights

- **AI Prototype**: [AI-Generated Prototype](https://dubium.no/Milestone2/DALL_E_Prompt_Exercise_1.webp)
- Notable differences include navigation layout, visual hierarchy, design consistency, and brand-specific imagery.
- Improvements made in the Figma prototype over the AI version focus on user interaction feedback, design consistency, and personalized branding elements.

## Conclusion

The Milestone 2 prototyping phase for the USN Co-Working Space project has laid a solid foundation for the website's development, incorporating both user-centric design principles and innovative AI-assisted visuals. Our Figma prototype serves as a blueprint for the final product, aiming to deliver a cohesive, engaging, and functional online presence for the USN Co-Working Space.
